# Current plan

# Yiru
* Want to look into the control points of the face...like first in the openCV ..what are the control points that we can use to determine the shape
* design the algorithm to generate the splines from images

# Kristen
* using facetracker, identify each main face feature (eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, face) and put in a simple SVG substitute for them (e.g. using the sample face Dave gave)
* so from facetracker, be able to input a basic svg face, but not yet making unique face
